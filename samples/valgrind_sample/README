Valgrind detection sample
--------------------------

Used code sample: small buffer size sample (bo_sample.c)

The sample will crash on first input file (mut/segf) multiple times.
On second input file (mut/valg), it won't crash but memory problems
are detected by valgrind.

There is no fuzzing incorporated in this sample as it's
using dfuzz.mut.plain pseudofuzzer which only copies its input
to output directory.

Compile with:
  gcc -o -ggdb3 sample bo_sample.c

Test with:
  dfuzz --debug --debug_output .

Observe output and check incidents with:
  incident_viewer incidents
