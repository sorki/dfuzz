External tools sample
---------------------

Used code sample: small buffer size sample (bo_sample.c)

The sample will crash on first input file (mut/segf) multiple times.
GDB and Valgrind outputs will be generated. Note
that this example runs noticable slower than minimal sample
due to use of valgrind.


Compile with:
  gcc -o -ggdb3 sample bo_sample.c

Test with:
  dfuzz --debug --debug_output .

Observe output and check incidents with:
  incident_viewer incidents
